# myMuliplicationTableGame
A math game
What I want to do is:
1. make a mulipication table
2. use js to load the table
3. use js to add the fields together
4. hid the answeres so only the top row is showing an the right column is showing
5. how i want the game to work is at the top of the page it will flash a number and with math the user will need to click the approperate box if the correct box is clicked then it will be a win if not will be a lose.
